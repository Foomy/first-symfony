First-Symphony
==============

My first steps in symphony, doctrine and twig.

Use case
--------
In order to learn about the important elements I decided to implement
a small user management, because this is the most common use case in
applications.

Components
----------
This small app has the following components

Public pages:

* Homepage
* Login page
* Register page

Pages restricted to users:

* User profile
* Edit profile

Pages restricted to admin:

* Userlist page
    + Delete user
